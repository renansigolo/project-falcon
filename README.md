#### ** That's it ! Your're ready to go ;) **

## How it works !?

**Watch**

- The watch command will compile SASS, JS and JS Libraries in real time

**Distribution Workflow**

Gulp optimize you code to the production environment. The workflow does the following:

- Clean the dist folder

- SASS

  Create sourcemaps,

  Use autroprefixer to ensure compatibility with the 2 last versions of all web browsers,

  Minify the code with cssnano,

  Rename `*.sass` to `styles.min.css`

  Paste in `/src/assets/css/`

- JS

  Create sourcemap,

  Minifiy the code with uglify,

  Concat all files in `/src/assets/_pre/js/`

  Paste scripts.min.js in `/src/assets/js/`

- Concat JS libraries

- Minify HTML files

- Optimize Images (GIF, SVG, ICO, JPG, JPEG, PNG)

- Copy remaining files

## Commands

- To serve your files and reload the browser after compile use: `npm start`

- To compile only js and sass files use: `npm run build`

- To compile everything in order to deploy to production use: `gulp` or `npm run build:prod`

- To auto-format your code and make it look pretty use: `npm run prettier`
