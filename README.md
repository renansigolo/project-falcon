## How it works !?

**Watch**

* The watch command will compile SASS, JS and JS Libraries in real time

**Distribution Workflow**

Gulp optimize you code to the production environment. The workflow does the following:

* Clean the dist folder

* SASS

    Create sourcemaps,

    Use autroprefixer to ensure compatibility with the 2 last versions of all web browsers,

    Minify the code with cssnano,

    Rename `*.sass` to `styles.min.css`

    Paste in `/src/assets/css/`

* JS

    Create sourcemap,

    Minifiy the code with uglify,

    Concat all files in `/src/assets/_pre/js/`

    Paste scripts.min.js in `/src/assets/js/`

* Concat JS libraries

* Minify HTML files

* Optimize Images (GIF, SVG, ICO, JPG, JPEG, PNG)

* Copy remaining files


## Gulp Commands

* To serve your files and reload the browser after compile use: `gulp serve`

* To watch your files use: `gulp watch`

* To compile only js and sass files use: `gulp compile`

* To compile everything in order to deploy to production use: `gulp`
